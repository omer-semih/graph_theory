# Problem 1
#
# Given a set V = {v0,v1,v2,...,vn-1} and a set of
# constraints {c0, c1, ..., cm} where each constraint is of the
# form (vi, vj).  A topological ordering of V is a permutation of
# V which satisfies all the constraints.   Each constraint (vi,vj)
# has the meaning that vi precedes vj in the ordering.
#
# For example [0,1,3,2] and [0,1,2,3] are both topological
# orderings of {0,1,2,3} subject to constraints [(0,3),(1,2)],
# but [3,1,2,0] is not.  Note also that [1,2,3] and  [1,2,3,2]
# are not permutations of {0,1,2,3} so they are certainly not
# topological orderings thereof.
#
# Write a function is_topological_order(n,constraints,permutation)
# which returns a Boolean indicating whether the given permutation
# is a valid permutation  of  {v0, v1, v2, ..., vn-1} and
# satisfies the given constraints.
# --- n is a positive integer indicating that the sequence is
#     {0, 1, 2, ..., n-1}
# --- constraints is a list of pairs (a,b) indicating that a must
#      precede b
# --- permutation is a list of integers

# Problem 2
#
# Given a non-empty set V = {0, 1, ..., n-1} and a set of
# constraints {c1, c2, ..., cm} where each constraint is of
# the form (vi, vj)∈V2, a topological ordering of V is a permutation
# of V which satisfies all the constraints.   Each constraint (vi,vj)
# has the meaning that vi precedes vj in the ordering.
# Write a function topological_sort(n,constraints) which returns
# a permutation of [0,1,...,n-1] which satisfies all the constraints.
# If multiple such permutations are possible, return any one of them.
# Be careful!  Sometimes the constraints can be contradictory.
# For example, it is impossible to order {0,1,2} subject to the
# constraints [(0,1),(1,2),(2,0)].
# If no permutation of V exists which satisfies all the
# constraints, the function must return False.
